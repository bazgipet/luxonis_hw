# luxonis_hw
Scraped the first 500 items (image, name, location and price) from sreality.cz and saved it online in the Postgresql database. 
Implemented a simple HTTP server and showing these 500 items on a nice page (with pagination) 
Using responsive and catch-eye design 
Everything put to single docker-compose command so just run "docker-compose up" in the Github repository and see the scraped ads on http://127.0.0.1:8080/estate page.
Use Typescript and React for implementation.
